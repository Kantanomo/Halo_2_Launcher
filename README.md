# Halo_2_Launcher Archived Source
The purpose of this repo is to open the source code of the original H2PC Launcher source code, for historical purposes. The reason for doing this is that this launcher contains knowledge on the research done into the game that can be found no where else. I believe it is a resposibility to myself to make sure this knowledge is public for people who may decide to pickup the game in the future. 

I have reverted a couple of commits that you can see in the commit log that removed specific parts of the launcher, I did this because the changes in the last few commits are of no consiquence of being in the final commit. They will be avaliable for viewing in the commit log.

#Note
This will not compile as it is missing a still private library that may or may not be released in the future.
